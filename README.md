# Hi, I'm Nithin Sivakumar! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a CS and Business student at UT Austin, passionate about applying AI to backend systems, DevOps workflows, and data platforms to build smarter, more efficient tools.

Outside of tech, I watch too many movies, play tennis, and follow the Mavs as they sell our future. Connect with me at nithin06.siva@gmail.com!
